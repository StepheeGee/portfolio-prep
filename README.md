### Tell me about yourself

**Catchy Title:** "LegalTech Innovator"

**Personal Headline:** "Merging Law & Code for Transformative Solutions"

**Excitement in Tech:**

You know, what really gets me excited about tech is how it gives us this amazing power to create. I mean, think about it — being able to blend legal know-how with coding skills to build dependable solutions like The Dad Firm without having to rely on unpredictable contractors. That's what really fires me up about tech! But I'm also jaded. So there's that.

**Professional Pitch:**

I've been an attorney for the past decade. I became interested in tech three years ago when I had an idea for a start - up. The Dad Firm. Custody coaching software for the self represented and unwed dad in Georgia.

I hit a roadblock with developers who couldn't deliver. It was a disappointment and headache, but it got me thinking.

I didn’t know anything about coding, so trusted they would do the job. And it’s not prudent to blindly trust anyone. Not even the experts.

So now I’m at the point where I need to do something different.

I need to educate myself.

And here we are.
